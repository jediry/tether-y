Tether-Y
========

Companion program to the Tether-X cellular WiFi hot-spot app. Tether-X is a Windows Phone app that enables the phone
to function as a WiFi hot-spot for a Windows 7+ PC, using the phone's normal data connection (i.e., you don't have to
pay for a special "tethering" data plan in order to use it). Unfortunately, using Tether-X requires several manual
steps on the PC side to connect. That's where Tether-Y comes in: it's a simple program that automates most of the
process, allowing your PC to easily connect and disconnect from the Tether-X connection.
